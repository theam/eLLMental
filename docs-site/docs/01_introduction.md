# Introduction

eLLMental is the ultimate library of components for building LLM-driven projects in the JVM.

Wanna try? Go straight to the [Getting Started Guide](02_getting_started.md), or keep reading to know more about eLLMental.

## What can you do with eLLMental?

### Embeddings Semantic Space Component

Embedding models are a special kind of Large Language Models (LLMs) that allow, given a piece of text, to calculate a large vector that represents a point in what we call the semantics space. This semantics space has the property that two pieces of text that are semantically related will be placed close to each other, allowing us to calculate a semantic distance between any two given pieces of text. Embeddings can be used to implement powerful search features that go beyond keyword matching, find related documents in a large database, or detect duplicates even when they're written with completely different words.

The Embeddings Space Component provides straightforward interfaces to create and operate with embeddings, find the semantically closest documents to a given piece of text and many other operations. See the Embeddings Semantic Search Component documentation page for more details.

### Text Generation Component

Text generation is the reason why LLMs became mainstream. This component provides text generation features that enable use cases like text completion, summarization, translation or explanations. Access the Text Generation Component documentation page for more details.

## eLLMental Principles

These are the design principles behind eLLMental:

1. **Simplicity in Complexity:** We aim to make the AI development process as simple and intuitive as developing any other software, hiding unneeded implementation details and glue code so the developer can focus on creating value.

2. **Readiness for Production:** From development to deployment, all features of eLLMental are crafted with a production-ready mindset.

3. **Continuous Improvement:** eLLMental continuously evolves for the better. With the support of our active community and dedicated team, we regularly implement improvements and introduce new features to keep expanding what is possible.
